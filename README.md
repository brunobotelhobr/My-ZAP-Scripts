# My-ZAP-Scripts

Scripts to make OWASP ZAP authenticate with REST APIs.

The OWASP-REST-Auth.js script does authentication and can set a cookie or global variable to be used as a header with OWASP-REST-Authorizarion-Keeper.js
The OWASP-REST-Authorizarion-Keeper.js script takes a global variable and adds it as the Authorization Header to each request.
